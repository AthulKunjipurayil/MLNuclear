Discovering Nuclear Models from Machine Learning
In this work, we present how Machine Learning models, such as Fully Connected Neural 
Networks (FC Nets) and Symbolic Regressions, can aid in deriving insights from nuclear 
data. We have demonstrated that FC Nets are effective in predicting nuclear data trends across the 
entire nuclear chart with minimal error. 
However, these models are insufficient in capturing the underlying 
physics at the level of local isotopic chains. To address this, 
we explored the use of Symbolic Regression as a tool to overcome such 
limitations. Despite its potential, our current model requires further 
modifications to align its predictions with established phenomenological 
models, such as the Liquid Drop Model of nuclei. Recent advancements in Symbolic 
Regression techniques for nuclear physics data shows hope in enhancing both 
theoretical and experimental understanding. These developments can help address 
key questions from new perspectives, paving the way for improved modeling and analysis.
